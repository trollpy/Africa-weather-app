# Weather App 🌦️

A web application that fetches and displays accurate weather data for any location worldwide using a third-party API.
## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to:
✅ Fetch and handle data from an external REST API (OpenWeatherMap or similar).
✅ Process JSON responses and dynamically render weather information.
✅ Implement user input for location-based searches.
✅ Handle API errors and edge cases (e.g., invalid locations).

Note: The live demo was taken down to comply with the API provider's terms of service and to protect sensitive API keys.
### 🛠️ Technologies Used

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

    API: OpenWeatherMap (or specify your API)

    Deployment: Netlify (previously live)

#### 🚀 Features

    Real-time Weather Data

        Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

    Location Search

        Users can enter any city/country to get weather details.

    Responsive UI

        Works on mobile and desktop.

##### ⚠️ Why the App Was Taken Down

    The API provider requires API keys to be kept private (exposing them in client-side code violates their terms).

    GitGuardian flagged the API key exposure, prompting its removal.

    Future improvements:

        Use a backend proxy (Node.js, Firebase) to hide API keys.

        Switch to API providers with free tiers for public projects (e.g., WeatherAPI).

###### 🔧 How to Run Locally

    Clone the repo:
    bash

git clone [your-repo-url]  

Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap (or your provider).

Create a .env file and add your key:
env

    API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"  

    Open index.html in a browser.

####### 📚 Lessons Learned

    API Security: Never expose keys in frontend code—use environment variables or a backend.

    Error Handling: Gracefully manage API limits/invalid requests.

    User Experience: Design clear interfaces for data-heavy apps.

# Africa-weather-app

this is a simple weather app project

the main aim of this app is to show my nderstanding of intergrating the API in the web development. the use of openweatherap API was a way forward as it is reliable and convinient 

the app seaches for towns of any african country and will show the current weather condition and forecast to more three coming days
