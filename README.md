# Africa-weather-app

this is a simple weather app project

the main aim of this app is to show my nderstanding of intergrating the API in the web development. the use of openweatherap API was a way forward as it is reliable and convinient 

the app seaches for towns of any african country and will show the current weather condition and forecast to more three coming days
